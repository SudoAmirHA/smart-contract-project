## Smart Contract Project
##### This is an idea for a university project on smart contracts written in 2020. In this project, there are a number of contracts that need to be approved by a number of validators. There are a number of specific contracts that need to be approved by specific units. In this project, a report of the performance of these validators with the number of tasks each one performs is output. The code comments are written in Persian Finglish
